            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>They are one by way of participation, for I am to prove to you, that the participation of the holy Ghoſt, either in an extraordinary or ordinary manner, is a participation of the ſame holy Ghoſt; not that theſe are the

                     <hi>(a) The laſt thing Mr.</hi> Danſon <hi>ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was, that the promiſe mas made to none at all; what ſence this is, the reader may judge. But whetker it be ſenſe or no, I am ſure it is a a Contradiction to what he ſaith now</hi> (viz.) <hi>that there is a promiſe of the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt in</hi> Joel <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before ſaith the promiſe was made to none at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides what is that promiſe in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. made to ſome that are not true believers? It is indeed that promiſe which is expounded and fulfilled in the 2. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> only to true believers; for the Apoſtles were all true believers, and the holy Ghoſt fell upon them. Now Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> brings this as an inſtance againſt the univerſality of my <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, that the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit are promiſed to ſome that are not true believers.</p>

                  <p>In the 8 of the <hi>Acts.</hi> 12.13. <hi>verſes</hi> he tells us there; that when they believed <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> preaching the things concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were Baptized both men and women; then <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf believed alſo: and when he was Baptized he continued with <hi>Philip</hi> and wondred, beholding the miracles and ſigns which were done.

                  <p>But doth this prove that any of them were not True believers, you are to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the holy Ghoſt was promiſed to ſome that were not True believers, and you prove the quite contrary, that it was given to them that did believe.</p>

                  <p>I will ſhew you why it is not a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf believed alſo; and the Scripture likewiſe affirms concerning him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>Thus far it is to our purpoſe, becauſe the Scripture in all its promiſes which it makes to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34137:19"/>believers, it reſpects them as they are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble belivers, not as they are True believers.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, give me an inſtance where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the holy Ghoſt was ever made to an unbeliever, or to a man that did not Truly believve.</p>

                  <p>The promiſe of Salvation is made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers promiſcuouſly, but doth it therefore follow, that they are believers? becauſe they profeſs it <hi>(pray hear me)</hi> It is upon the preſumption that they are True believers; I ſay it is a promiſe made to none but True believers.</p>

                  <p>This I Aſſerted, that Chriſtians were not bound to believe that God commanded them to avoid that which they could not but do; you gave this diſtinction that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was poſſible in it ſelf, or in relation to the ſubject commanded, but not poſſible with reſpect to the decree of God.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ſaid that thoſe Cautions that are given to viſible believers in general, that they ſhould take heed of falling away, did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the poſſibility of it in the nature of the thing; (In True believers alſo) becauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34137:20"/>man is but mutable, and grace is but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore certainly it may be loſt; and yet it is certainly Impoſſible as to True believers, upon the ſuppoſition of the divine decree, and Chriſts promiſe to preſerve and uphold the grace of True believers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This is juſt as if a man ſhould ſay the whole Earth is poſſible to be overflowed with Water in reſpect to the nature of it, but with reſpect to the decree of God it is Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but then if God hath made ſuch a decree, no man hath any more reaſon to fear a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal inundation, becauſe of ſuch a decree, then he had to fear it if it were impoſſible, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the nature of the thing: in like manner if it be impoſſible to fall from grace, with respect to the decree of God; there is no more reaſon to fear falling, then there would have been had it been impoſſible, with respect to the nature of the thing: but to proceed,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sum then of my firſt Argument is this, If True believers cannot fall away finally; they ought to believe they cannot ſo fall away: Now if they ought to believe they cannot fall away finally, then it is not reaſonable for them either to fear they can ſo fall, or to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or sautioned to take heed of it; if God hath decreed it ſhall never be.</hi>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34137:20"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sum of the ſecond Argument is; that ſuch as are partakers of the divine Nature may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; therefore True believers may: this I prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this reaſon, becauſe ſome that partake of the holy Ghoſt, as it is ſaid,</hi> Heb. 6. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome that did partake of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might fall away, becauſe none were ever made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, (as Mr.</hi> Danſon <hi>hath expounded it for the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts of it) but ſuch as were first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine Nature (as he expounds the divine Nature)</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>For the inward and ſpecial graces of it: now if none had the promiſe of ſuch a partaking of the holy Ghoſt, but thoſe that firſt did ſo partake of the divine Nature, as aforeſaid, then it muſt needs follow, that if thoſe that partake of the holy Ghoſt may fall away, then they that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the divine Nature may fall away; but the</hi> 6 <hi>of the</hi> Hebrews <hi>tells us ſuch my fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi> Ergo,</p>
                  <p>My next Argument is this; to prove that ſome True believers may fall away totally and finally from grace.</p>
                  <p>If all thoſe that have the Chracters of true and ſincere believers mentioned in the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5, 6. may fall away totally and finally; then True believers may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way totally and finally.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>I gave you this general inſtance; the Scripture affirms that which takes in all theſe, it ſtiles thoſe believers that were not real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
                  <p>That is no proper anſwer, becauſe if I ſay none but True believers have theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then theſe muſt be True believers that are ſo qualified, but none but True believers have theſe qualifications.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Scripture applies them to any elſe, you muſt ſhew where it doth.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>It doth not follow, that if the Scripture doth not apply theſe Characters to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that therefore they are True believers that are ſo qualified.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
                  <p>True believers is a word hardly to be found in the Scriptures, though we have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting all this while about it, but we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by True believers, a man that is not a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that doth not pretend to what he hath not, or is not. Now I ſay, I do not know where the Scripture tells us any where to the contrary, and if that be not our guide,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34137:24"/>we are all in the dark. Now if the Scripture gives us theſe for Characters of True believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tells us the contrary are not True believers; we have no reaſon to judge that man not a True believer, that hath theſe Characters: for we have no rule to judge any man a believer, or not a believer, but by the Characters the Scripture gives us of True believers, and of ſuch as are not ſo.</p>

                  <p>This is one part of the powers of the World to come, that is to ſay, a dreadful ſenſe and apprehenſion, he had upon him of the future judgment; and then in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.15. <hi>And when one of them that ſat at meat with him heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God,</hi> he had here ſome affectionate tranſports at the narration that was made concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of happyneſs, <hi>and Chriſt directs a Parable to him.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed I am much beholding to you, and you have done me a kindneſs in bringing that to my mind that was out before, Now the

                  <p>I do; for at the latter end of the Parable, Chriſt gives Inſtance that thoſe that were bidden <hi>ſhould not taſt of the Supper,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to him, and the general import of it is to ſhew that many perſons are called, that yet notwithſtanding in Truth and Reality do not obey the call.</p>

                  <p>It will, Becauſe this Parable was directed particularly to him; and Secondly, Becauſe it is ſaid, that he to whom his diſcourſe was directed, was of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of whom the Scripture tells us, <hi>a great number of them were open enemies to him, and ſome of them,</hi> though the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they did believe on him, yet would not confeſs him, least he ſhould put them out of the Synagogue; becauſe they loved the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God.</hi>

                  <p>There is two thing in this Text yet in queſtion as I have told you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether this man taſted of the powers of the World to come: for the text doth not ſay ſo, but implies the contrary; for he did not taſt of the Supper, for a man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34137:33"/>may be raviſhed with joy at the intelligence of buſineſs, and yet for all that theſe may die, and faint, and flag upon him, and he may never have a true ſenſe and ſavour of them. Nor,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth the text ſay (if it were ſo) that he was not a True believer; you ſay he was not, and that firſt, becauſe Chriſt addreſſes himſelf to him by a Parable; and Secondly, becauſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi> many of them were not True believers (of whom you ſuppoſe he was one) but this is arguing and not anſwering; but it doth not follow, that becauſe ſome of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not True believers, therefore none of them were; and if I ſhould grant you the firſt anſwer, that he taſted of the powers of the World to come; how doth this prove that he was not a True believer? But I lay the ſtreſs of my anſwer upon the firſt <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he did not Taſt of the Supper: for you ſay the Parable was directed to him, and applied to him, and Chriſt ſaith of him, <hi>that he was one that was invited;</hi> and if ſo nothing is more plain, <hi>v</hi> 24. then that he did not taſt, but if he had taſted, it is as hard to prove that he was not a True believer.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Danſon.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe I ſay the perſons of whom this was ſpoken, were <hi>Phariſees</hi> of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34137:34"/>affirms, that either they were <hi>open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or ſecret friends.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>That is no proof; for if they were <hi>ſecret friends</hi> they were <hi>friends.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>But Chriſt gives this account of them, that they would not confeſs him, becauſe they loved the praiſe of men more then God.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>You bring this Inſtance to ſhew two things. Firſt, that this man to whom Chriſt directs his ſpeech, had a taſt of the powers of the World to come, and alſo that he was no True believers, but whether it doth any more then prove he did not taſt, I leave to conſideration, and proceed to a fourth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>If they that have clean eſcaped the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this evil World, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, may fall away totally and finally, then True believers may fall away totally and finally. But they that have clean eſcaped the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this evil World, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, may fall away totally and finally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> True believers may fall away totally and finally.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34137:34"/>
                  <p>Or if you pleaſe thus,</p>
                  <p>They are true believers that have clean eſcaped the pollutions of this evil world through the knowledge of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt:</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſuch may fall away totally and finally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some true believers may fall away totally and finally.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>You put the ſubject of the queſtion into the <hi>major,</hi> and the predicate of the queſtion into the <hi>minor;</hi> your concluſion is, that true believers may fall away.</p>

                  <p>And do I not conclude ſo my argument is this, and I argue rightly;</p>
                  <p>That if thoſe that have clean eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt may fall away, Then true believers may fall away:</p>
                  <p>But ſuch may fall away;</p>

                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                  <p>What <hi>Paul</hi> uſed all diligence, and labour to prevent the coming to paſs of, might po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Paul</hi> uſed all labour and diligence to prevent his falling away totally and finally.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Sir, that which I urge is a clear Caſe, yours doth not reach the Caſe: If ſo be the Inſtance had been Parrallel, I would have ſaid more to it, but yet I will ſay ſomething to it, notwithſtanding the Caſe lies here, either <hi>Paul</hi> did labour to prevent his apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or he did not; the Text tells us he did labour leaſt by any means whilſt he preached to others, he himſelf ſhould become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; you ſay it was impoſſible it ſhould be ſo, you apply this to the Caſe of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that God had added 15 years to his Life, but I ſay that God had not added 15 years to his Life abſolutely as you inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, but conditionally in caſe he made uſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34137:41"/>of the ordinary means; and if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had not done this, he had not been ſhot-free: for he was not under a neceſſity of avoiding all manner of danger, and it follows that if <hi>Paul</hi> had refuſed the means, he had as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have fallen, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had dyed if he had not eaten.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>This I ſay, that grace is of its own nature looſable, and that grace that is reſtored by Chriſt, may as well be loſt as <hi>Adams</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, yet notwithſtanding thoſe cautions that are given about apoſtacy and falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that are given to all viſible believers, are not unneceſſary, becauſe God makes uſe of our own endeavours as the means by which our apoſtacy is to be prevented.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>This is not to the Argument, becauſe the Argument is not made indefinitely, of viſible believers, but it is grounded upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance of the Apoſtle, whom you ſay knew it was impoſſible for him to fall away therefore the Sum of my Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the proof of this:</p>
                  <p>If as you have ſaid, he knew he could not fall away, to what purpoſe ſhould he uſe endeavours to prevent it; to what end ſhould any man bid me beware of that place, or pit; that both he and I knew it was

                  <p>If we could ſuppoſe that there was any ſuch ſecurity, that a man ſhould obtain ſuch and ſuch an end without the uſe of the means; yet there was good and ſufficient Reaſon to make uſe of thoſe means from that tye and obligation that God hath laid by way of command, as in the inſtance of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> where God promiſed to add to his days 15 years.</p>

                  <p>It is ordinary in Scripture, for things to be laid down abſolutely, that are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood conditionally; but however that will not reach our caſe.

                  <p>And now you ſubſtitute a contrary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, <hi>(viz)</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the loſing, that eſteem and reputation which he had among Chriſtians.

                  <p>You may urge them argumentwiſe, and then <hi>Sir</hi> the queſtion is this, whether it be impoſſible for any true believer to fall away totally and finally from grace? And you may remember (that we might not put any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable termes upon each other) by Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, we underſtood the Word, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch, as either have, may, might, or can fall away; and then with reſpect to true believers, we underſtood ſuch as had true faith in oppoſition to hypocrites; or ſuch as whatſoever Truth they may believe, do not believe the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion or of the Chriſtian Faith: We alſo underſtood by falling away totally, wholly to renounce the Chriſtian Faith; and by Finally, ſo to depart from the Faith, as at laſt to periſh Eternally; and by the grace of God, we meant the love and favour of God, that men might fall away from it and periſh.</p>

                  <p>There was only to my remembrance but two arguments uſed by you the laſt time, that were of any ſeeming force; the one was in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34137:46"/>the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> about the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and this was the iſſue that you did urge it to, that it was altogether needleſs and unneceſſary, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have any caution given him, or that he ſhould make uſe of any caution to prevent that which is impoſſible, as to the event and againſt that I ſhall direct my Arguments.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I will prevent you a little, I am now ſtanding in the place of a reſpondent, and you are oppenent; and what ever you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, do it diſtinctly; and do not incumber your diſpute with what I ſaid as opponent, but make what advantage you can in the proſecution of your Argument of whatever I ſaid then; and if you will not do thus, I will not anſwer you. My Reaſon I ſhall give you is this, becauſe it will bring us back again into the place, where we were before of my being opponent and you reſpondent; and to what you ſay as to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> you may remember you anſweredme, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo others might labour to prevent the coming to paſs of that which they knew was impoſſible for to come to paſs, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the decree of God, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the nature of the thing.

                  <p>Is that the Queſtion? our Queſtion is this, whether it be poſſible for any True believers to fall away totally and finally? and not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them hath fallen away; for if there hath not any of them fallen away, yet it is poſſible they may: Therefore if I could not ſhew you an inſtance of any bodys falling away, will it follow, that it is impoſſible for any to fall away? I gave you arguments the laſt day from the nature of the thing that they might fall away, and therefore if I could not give you an inſtance of any that did ſo fall, your Argument is not therefore proved; it is poſſible for a man to Steal and Lye. Now what if I could never prove that ever any man did Steal or Lye, doth this prove it is impoſſible for a man to Steal and Lye? But <hi>Sir,</hi> I offer this fair propoſition to you, that I will diſpute my Arguments over again with you when you pleaſe, the very ſame I urged the laſt day, and provide the beſt anſwers you can.</p>

                     <hi>The ſum of Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>his Anſwer is this, Firſt, that Mr.</hi> Danſon <hi>did many times in his arguings, not conclude the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, That ſometimes Mr.</hi> Danſon <hi>begged the queſtion when he ſhould have proved it; and ſometime Mr.</hi> Danſon <hi>confeſſed he could not prove it: And laſtly Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>told Mr.</hi> Danſon, <hi>that it did not follow, that no True believer could poſſibly fall, if there were no examples of any that had fallen; for there is no example in all the Bible, of any True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that ever murdered his own child. Doth it therefore follow, that it is impoſſible for any True believer to turn back from the holy command and commit ſuch a ſin? But urther, whoever looks back into the former days diſcourſe, will find that Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>did not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34137:54"/>bring the 6th of the</hi> Heb <hi>and the</hi> 2 Pet. 2. <hi>to prove that ſome True believer had faln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but to prove that ſome True believers might fall away; for both thoſe Texts are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical, and were brought to prove ſome True believers might fall away, but they do not prove, neither were they brought to prove by way of example that ſome had fallen away; but did ſuppoſe the poſſibility thereof beyond contradiction.</hi>

I anſwer you fairly, I confeſs that True believers cannot ſin as wicked men do, <hi>quotenus,</hi> believers, ſo that it is True in one ſenſe, and Falſe in another; it is true while they are believers, and retain the ſavor of good things, they cannot ſin as wicked men do; but it is true alſo, that they may loſe this ſavor, and then they may ſin as wicked men do; therefore I ask <hi>Mr. Danſon</hi> in which ſenſe he means.</p>

                     <hi>Cannot, in Scripture phraſe doth not alway note an utter Impoſſibility appears, ſometimes it is put for a thing that is uncomely to be done, Mat. 9.15.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is put for want of disppoſition to do a thing, ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, Mark 6.5. That he could not do any mighty works there, that is, he was not diſpoſed to de any mighty works, becauſe of their unbelief; not that it was impoſſible for him to do any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It notes a preſent incapacity</hi> Joſh, 7.12. &amp; Ezek. 3.6. <hi>God tells the Prophet ſaying, I did not ſend thee to a People of a hard Language whoſe words thou canſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It may be ſaid, a thing cannot be done, when it cannot lawfully be done;</hi> Gen. 39.9. Joſeph <hi>ſaid be could not do that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and ſin againſt God, and</hi> Gen. 34.14 1 Cor. 10.21. <hi>In all theſe, or ſome of theſe respects it may be ſaid, He that is born of God cannot ſin; but yet</hi> David <hi>found it

I denyed the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I ſay he that is born of God may ſin ſo as to fall away, for he may forfeit the ſeed of God. But I will put a ſhort iſſue to this queſtion, <hi>Mr. Danſon</hi> is to prove to us, that the ſeed of God doth ſo remain in them, as that it can by no means ceaſe to be in them, that let them do what they will, they cannot but have the ſeed of God in them.</p>

                  <p>Yes it is, for the Scripture faith expreſly, that every unbeliever, while ſuch hath the wrath of God abiding on him, as it is ſaid of a believer, he hath the ſeed of God remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abiding in him: Now I would ask <hi>Mr. Danſon</hi> whether this phraſe, the wrath of God remaining or abiding upon an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, doth not reſpect the time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing an unbeliever? But now if he ſhall like <hi>Paul,</hi> or like the converts in the <hi>Acts,</hi> be prickt in his heart, and turn to God, I hope you will not ſay, that then the wrath of God abides upon him; in like manner as long as any man remains a believer, the ſeed of God abides in him; but when he departs
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34137:61"/>from being a believer, when he doth throw away, on caſt away bis conſidence in God, the ſeed of God doth not remain or abide in him. Prove therefore that it ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, or that it cannot chooſe but remain.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer that the reaſon you render, is the ſame the Scripture gives in other caſes.

                  <p>You diſpute now Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> pray let Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> alone; I deny that the <hi>8th</hi> of the <hi>Heb.</hi> refers to the <hi>32d</hi> of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> which is the Text under debate; for the <hi>8th</hi> of the <hi>Heb.</hi> refers to the 31 of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and therefore you cannot conclude from thence; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is the ſenſe of <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. But that we may not waſt time, I deny the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of all True believers: for here is Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi>'s Argument, whatever is ſpoken or predicated of all the Iſrael of God, is predicated of all True believers.</p>

                  <p>All that you have to de, is to prove that this is made to all True believers, let the thing promiſed be what it will: now you prove it becauſe it is made to the Iſrael of God; and my anſwer is, that there may be ſome things made to the Iſrael of God, that are not appropriated to all True believers.</p>

                  <p>You muſt tell <hi>Mr, Baxter</hi> ſo, and not me; I believe <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> knew as well as <hi>Mr. Fowler</hi> what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s opinion was; and ſo did Biſhop <hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> any body that is but a little acquainted with Learning, knows that he in the buſineſs of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> makes a diſtinction between thoſe that had real and ſpecial grace, and others.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> never ſaid in his Life, that any True believer ever fell away totally and finally; and he writ a Book particularly of the perſeverance of the Saints, that they never fall away totally and finally; And as for Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> you wrong that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing of Chriſt's prayer was always heard, either when he he prayed abſolutely or conditionally, that if they did ſuch and ſuch things, it ſhould ſo

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I will refer it, that the Argument is not as yet, capable of an Inſtance, ſo that I need not do it; but however, I will give you one, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. Chriſt prays that the <hi>World</hi> might <hi>believe;</hi> and he prays that his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors that crucified him, might <hi>believe and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34137:86"/>be forgiven,</hi> Luke 23.24. Now if Chriſt's prayer (as you ſay) was always abſolute, and he heard in all he prayed for; then thoſe he prayed for, were converted and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if they were never converted nor pardoned; then according to your ſenſe, he was not heard in all he prayed for, or ſome of his prayers were conditional.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay, he was heard in all he prayed for, but when we ſay Chriſt was heard in what he prayed for, we are to underſtand what Chriſt prayed for as mediatour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>How did he pray elſe, in this <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>John</hi> eſpecially.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>He prayed in the capacity of a private perſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Prove that if you can, that Chriſt did pray as a private perſon; but if you could prove that Chriſt prayed for ſomething (though as a private Perſon) that he was not heard in, then you prove againſt your ſelf, that he was not heard in all he prayed for.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>It was the effect of common Charity; I will give you an inſtance, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do;</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:34137:87"/>which Prayer was an effect of that Law of Charity, that he was under as he became man, and ſo obedient to the Law of loving his enemies, and ſo he prayed for ſomewhat, that did not inevitably and infalliby come to paſs.</p>

                  <p>You ſaid before, he was heard in all he Prayed for, and now you ſay, he Prayed for ſomething that did not come to paſs; and I gave you that Inſtance, that Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rayed, <hi>that the World might believe that God had ſent him;</hi> was that Prayer heard or not?</p>

                  <p>So was yours about their perſeverance, but you bid me give you an Inſtance, that Chriſt prayed for any thing that was not effected for, or upon thoſe for whom he prayed, and I have given you two Inſtances of ſome things that he prayed for, that was not actually effected upon thoſe for whom he prayed; therefore he was not heard in all he prayed for; if by hearing you mean ſo, as the things muſt abſolutely and inevitably come to paſs.</p>

                  <p>Give me I ſay, an Inſtance where Chriſt prayed as a publick, and as a private perſon, and then ſhew me that all he prayed for as a publick perſon, was abſolute, and did infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly come to paſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Danſon.</speaker>
                  <p>Chriſt was heard even in this prayer, he did make as a private perſon; becauſe that this prayer of his, was with ſubmiſſion unto the will of his Father, conſidering what he did in this, he did as a private perſon; as the Apoſtle faith, he deſired to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, it was his will as <hi>Humane,</hi> ſo Chriſt as he was under the Law was under an obligation of loving his enemies, and therefore for praying for them.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay Chriſt's prayer was heard as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon; and before you ſaid, it might or was not always heard as a private perſon; but he was alway heard as mediator. Now I bid you prove your diſtinction, and do not I anſwer fairly?</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ſay, Chriſt was heard when he prayed, that ſuch and ſuch men might believe by the uſe of means, and ſo that they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the uſe of means, and that others might be pardoned upon Repentance; but he was heard, though they did not believe becauſe he prayed for them upon that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for his prayer was alway, heard conditionally or abſolutely; Now I ask in which of theſe ſenſes you mean.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ſay, abſolutely in this caſe; that is, that Chriſt prayed for the perſeverance of all True believers without condition.</p>

               <sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I will prove that, that is the thing I aimed at; I ſay; Jeſus Chriſt in his prayer for his Enemies, was heard after the ſame manner, that any believers is heard when he prays for his enemies, becauſe there is in the matter of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34137:88"/>the prayer, there is a ſubmiſſion to the will of God, as to thoſe things which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular decree and councel of God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear about.</p>

                  <p>There is ſome things that Chriſt is ignorant of, as the day of Judgment, becauſe Chriſt faith, he did not know it.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>But the queſtion is ſtill where it was at firſt: for I ſay and grant unto you, that whatſoever Chriſt prayed for abſolutely, he was heard in; <hi>and whatſoever he prayed for upon condition, there is alſo a true ſenſe in which it may be ſaid, he was beard in all ſuch prayers, becauſe he did not pray for the pardon of his Enemies, but upon condition of their Repentance. Now if they had Repented, and had not been pardoned, then Chriſt was not heard in this prayer; but if they remained in Impenitency, and were never pardoned, he was nevertheleſs heard in this prayer;</hi> And now you are to prove that what he prayed for in this prayer for his Diſciples perſeverance, he prayed for abſolutely, and not conditionally, or elſe you do not argue of my diſtinction.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34137:89"/>could there be either ſuch fowl pollutions, or ſuch great diviſions among True believers? all which plainly ſhews, that Chriſt prays for theſe effects upon their uſe of ſuch means, as that they might thereby obtain both unity and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in like manner he prays for their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace, upon the condition of their uſe of means, as praying, watching,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Suppoſe that prayer was no anſwered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your way of explication, as to their being actually pardoned, yet then it makes againſt you, ſince you gave that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why True believers could not fall away;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34137:90"/>becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith himſelf, <hi>Father I thank thee thou haſt heard me always</hi> and that he was heard in all he prayed for, and thence you inferred they could not fall away that were True believers; becauſe Chriſt prayed for their perſeverance, and was heard in all he prayed for,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But is there not the ſame reaſon to conclude that all Chriſt's crucifters ſhall be forgiven; and that the World ſhall all believe in him; becauſe Chriſt prays for theſe things; if it ſhall be ſaid, Chriſt prayed for the World and his Enemies, as a private perſon, and ſo it might not come to paſs; Why may it not be ſaid, he prayed for the perſeverance of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as a private perſon, and ſo ſome may fall away not with standing; but if it be ſaid, he prayed for believers abſolutely and without condition, why may it not be ſaid he prayed ſo for the World and his Enemies.</hi>

                  <p>So that if you ſuppoſe in the one place, he was not heard, and in other places he was, then you muſt admit of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his praying, as a publick and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon.</p>

                  <p>I deny the Conſequence; for when Chriſt prayed that they might be converted, he prays (as be did for other things) according
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34137:90"/>to the rule he had preſcribed; Now you prove that he was heard as to this point of perſeverance, becauſe he was heard in all he prayed for. Now I confeſs, ſome things he was not heard in, in the ſenſe explained, as to the coming to paſs of them; and I have told you why, becauſe the prayer was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; when Chriſt here prays for all that ſhould believe, then he prays that the World might believe that the Father had ſent him; was that prayer abſolute? and was it heard? Did the World believe? Pray ſpeak Sir.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat many Godly and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Men in theſe late times, have held and believed, <hi>That it is impoſſible for any True believer to ceaſe to be ſuch, and fall away and periſh; I do not deny</hi> I am alſo ſenſible that their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter is grounded (as they think) either upon Gods Election, the Scripture Promiſes, and Chriſt's Prayers, or elſe upon the abſurd conſequences that follow upon the contrary opinion.</p>
            <p>Now as touching Gods Election, I ſhall freely grant, and it may eaſily be aſſented too; that thoſe whom God hath from the beginning choſe to Salvation through the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34137:92"/>ſanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth, ſhall never finally fall away and periſh, according to 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. but though this be granted, yet it doth not follow from hence, that no True believer, or that none who ſincerely believe can finally fall away; and in this caſe, let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (who in this point diſcents from me) ſpeak for me, <hi>I dare not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſay I am certain that all who</hi> do <hi>ſincerely believe, and are justified,</hi> are <hi>Elected to Salvation, and ſhall never finally fall away; It is my opinion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but I dare not put it in my Creed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how learned and godly Men do differ from me, and deny the certainty of perſeverance, I know how many ſad and ſhaking examples, theſe times have afforded, and therefore I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, properly, ſtrictly certain of my perſeverance, and ſo not fully ſtrictly certain of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> directions page 16.</p>
            <p>And in the end of his Appology <hi>I am not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>So certain of this doctrine of perſeverance, as I am that Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Redeemer of the World; I never</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>found the doctrine of certain perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in any Creed of the Church; I hope none dare ſay that all the Lutherans, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Anabaptiſts who are otherwiſe minded, are no Chriſtians, much leſs in the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church, which thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>

            <p>And again, in his account of his thoughts touching perſeverance, Page 5. he ſaith, <hi>That it was the judgment of St.</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>that though the Elect ſhould never fall away finally; yet he alſo believed and was perſwaded that ſome that were effectually called, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and juſtified, might fall away and periſh;</hi> And further in the ſame page he faith, <hi>That becauſe ſome are ſo immodest, as to queſtion whether this was St.</hi> Auguſtin's <hi>opinion. I add further, that I did ask the Reverend Biſhop</hi>

               </gap>ſher <hi>in the hearing of Dr.</hi> Kendal, <hi>whether this was not plainly the judgment of</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>and he anſwered undoubtedly it was; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Biſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>was as likely to know as any man I am capable of conſulting with; and if any be ſtill in doubt, the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges following, which are tranſcribed out of St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>may end his doubts,</hi> Auguſt, de bono perſever.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the laſt forecited book of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, tells us page 16. <q>That though he preſumes in this point, to diſcent from <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and the COMMON judgment of the teachers of that, and MANY former and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages, yet (ſaith he) I find my ſelf oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reverence of ſuch contradicting Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and forced alſo by the conſciouſneſs of my Ignorance, to ſuſpect my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and diſſent with modeſty, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contrary minded, and being willing to receive any further evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and page 17. I dare not ſay that I have attained to a certainty in underſtanding this point, &amp;c all the texts of Scripture that concern it, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and the common judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church for ſo many ages; and therefore I dare not ſay that I have attained to a certainty that all the juſtified ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere; and further in the ſame page, that can be no very eaſie point, which ALL or ALMOST ALL THE CHURCH FOR SO MANY AGES; and which not only moſt of the Chriſtians of the World, but alſo ſo many Nations of Proteſtants themſelves do erre in, and which the choiceſt Men for learning and diſigence, and thoſe that were the leaders in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as

                  </gap>s Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> ſo that not only from Scripture, but from the general conſent of all Antiquity; the docrin of the poſſibility of ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rue believers falling from Grace finally, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with an election of Grace, and Gods chooſing men from the beginning, through the ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth; from whence we may ſee, that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34137:94"/>though there is a number that ſhall certainly be ſaved according to an election of Grace; yet there may alſo be many that may have true juſtifying Faith, that may fall away and periſh, who never were in this number of Elect.</p>
            <p>So that this doctrine of the poſſibility of ſome True believers fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing away finally, no way interfers with the doctrin of Election, not do thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak concerning Election, ſo much as call the truth of this doctrin in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The other ground of the impoſſibility of any True believers falling away finally, is a miſtake of Scripture promiſes; here let me give notice of two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inds of promiſes in the Scripture about this matter. Firſt, ſuch as though they ſeem to be abſolute, yet they have conditions implyed in them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of ſuch Scriptures as promiſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe conditions; the firſt ſort, are as follows, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 18. <hi>You that have followed me in the regeneration</hi> (or in the Reſurrection) <hi>ſhall ſit upon</hi> 12 <hi>Thrones judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> 12 <hi>Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. Now this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſeems to be abſolute, and <hi>Judas</hi> was one of thoſe 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to whom it was made; but the condition implyed was, that they ſhould alway to the end continue in his ſervice; and therefore <hi>Judas</hi> falling away, and not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34137:95"/>performing the condition, never came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruition of the promiſe. Again, 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>I ſaid indeed that thy houſe &amp; the houſe of thy Father ſhould walk beforeme for ever;</hi> but now the Lord ſaith, <hi>be it far from me; for them that honour me, I will honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is often promiſed to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, yet <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.27. the Lord tells them that if they corrupt themſelves, <hi>He will ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them among the Nations, and they ſhall be left few in number among the Heathen, where he will lead them;</hi> And ſo <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.17, 18, 19. God promiſes (as one would think upon the firſt view, abſolutely) <hi>that he would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Iſrael <hi>from among the People, and give them one heart, and put a new ſpirit in them;</hi> but yet he tells them in <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.27 &amp; 37. <hi>v.</hi> compared together, that he will do this upon a condition, as is there expreſt; <hi>yet for all this, will I be inquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael; and ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. &amp; <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40, 41, there we read of a Covenant (which ſome call abſolute; but I muſt needs ſay an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Covenant in their ſenſe, is abſolute non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe) in which God promiſes many things, but yet he tells the ſame People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>That IF they will incline their Ears and come to him, he will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34137:95"/>&amp; in this ſenſe God's promiſes, that ſem abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in form, are to be conditionally underſtood <hi>As be that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, and ſhall not come into condemnation,</hi> John 8.34. &amp; John 5.24. &amp; Plalm 125.1. <hi>He that truſts in the Lord, ſhall be as mount Sion, that never ſhall be removed.</hi> Now if theſe promiſes are abſolute, then this muſt be the ſenſe of ſuch Scriptures; that if men have once truly believed and truſted in God, they ſhall inevitably be ſaved; let them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after truſt or diſtruſt, believe or disbelieve, or whether they be not; or whether they be; Whoremongers, Adulterers, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; yet they ſhall be ſaved and abide for ever. Now if this be not the ſenſe, then theſe promiſes, and all of that kind muſt be underſtood conditionally, that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and continueth in believing, and that truſteth in the Lord; and continueth in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; upon theſe tearms and conditions he ſhall be ſaved and abide for ever; and to this agrees all theſe plain and expreſs Scriptures, which being well conſidered, will explain all thoſe texts and promiſes that ſeem to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, as to the form of them, <hi>John</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>10. <q>IF YE keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love. and <hi>John</hi> 14.23. IF any man love me, he will keep my ſayings and my Father will love him, and we will
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34137:96"/>come unto him, and dwell with him, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23. And you that were in time paſt Strangers and Enemies in your minds, by wicked works; now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you blameleſs, and unreproveable in his ſight. IF YE continue in the Faith, grounded and ſettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 3.14. We are made partakers of Chriſt, IF WE hold faſt the beginning of OUR CONFIDENCE firm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a crown of Life. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. he that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. the juſt ſhall live by Faith, but if he draw back my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much like theſe promiſes (that ſeem abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute) are ſuch Scriptures that promiſe eternal Life to men without any exception, or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt queſtion of their perſeverance, when that life and bleſſing promiſed, is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon their change; <hi>as he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall not ſee Death, and he that drinketh,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never Thirſt;</hi> this plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that theſe promiſes, ſuppoſe their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſo doing: ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs before my
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34137:96"/>Father which is in Heaven, &amp; whoſoever ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me before men, him will I deny before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat 10.32, 33. Now <hi>Judas</hi> did confeſs Chriſt before men, but he had no right or claim to this promiſe, becauſe he did not Perſevere in this confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in like manner <hi>Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, but he was not denyed by Chriſt before his Father in Heaven, becauſe he did not perſiſt and dye in the denying of him.</p>
            <p>But yet we may ſee that the promiſes of the one, and the threatening of the other, is made without exception, and wherever we read of any ſuch promiſes, a poſſibility of a change is ſuppoſed; for when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that believeth in the Son, bath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, and ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it doth no more ſuppoſe it impoſſible for that man to fall away, and have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſuſpended; then the other text that ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth or remaineth upon him,</hi> doth ſuppoſe it Impoſſible for this man ever to believe, and to have the wrath of God, or the execution of vengeance ſuſpended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his believing; to this may be reduced all Scriptures that ſeem to promiſe a bleſſing or threaten wrath, according to mens preſent ſtate and condition, though both the one and the other may be ſuſpended upon
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34137:97"/>their change, and that an impoſſibility of a change, is not to be underſtood more by the one Scripture that promiſes Salvation to the believer, then by the other, that tells us wrath remains upon the unbeliever. But to this, it is uſually replyed, <hi>that though it be true, there are promiſes that are conditional; yet God hath promiſed to perform thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for them to whom be graciouſly makes ſuch promiſes; and therefore it is not poſſible for any True believer to fall away finally.</hi> This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is grounded upon the promiſes of the ſecond kind, that I before premiſed, and they are ſuch promiſes as 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>But the Lord is faithful who ſhall ſtabliſh and keep you from evil,</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>He that hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8, 9. <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you to the end,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Pet. 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the mighty power of God, through faith unto Salvation,</hi> Phil. 2 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> 1 Thef. 5.24. <hi>Faithful is he which hath called you, Who alſo will do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe Scriptures do not prove that which they are alledged for, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Go hath abſolutely undertaken and ingaged for all True believers ſo; and at that rate,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34137:97"/>that ler them do what they can, they cannot ceaſe to be True believers.</p>
            <p>But ſuch Scriptures as thoſe laſt named do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſure all True believers that God will not be wanting on his part, to effect their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; if they are not wanting to themſelves; and for the better underſtanding hereof, we are to conſider that God is ſaid to work thoſe vertues in us, and to do all for us, when he vouchſafeth ſufficiency of means for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof, though the thing be never effected; thus Chriſt is ſaid to take away the ſins of the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. Though the World lyeth in wickedneſs, becauſe he hath done that which is ſufficient to take away the ſin of the World, and to cleanſe them from all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe the Scripture ſpeaks in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.42. <hi>becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, th u ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee;</hi> God in this place, is ſaid to have PURGED THEM THAT WERE NOT PURGED, becauſe he had vouchſafed proper and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means for their Purgation; and ſo St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt, <hi>As much as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Phyſician, he came to ſave, and heal the Sick, and he ſlayeth himſelf that will not obſerve the precepts of the Phyſician.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:34137:98"/>
            <p>And after this manner, the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>That the goodneſs of God, did lead them to Repentance;</hi> though many of them were ſo far from being lead to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he tells them that <hi>after their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency of heart, they treaſured up to themſelves, wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> &amp;c. In this ſenſe are thoſe Scriptures to be underſtood of Gods keeping believers from falling and preſerving them to the end; and of his promiſe that they ſhall be kept from evil, which whether it be of the evil of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or the evil of Sin, believers are never ſo kept, but that they may, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do fall into the one, and the other, and therefore thoſe texts muſt be underſtood of Gods doing thoſe things by his gracious vouchſafement of means, ſufficient to keep believers from evil, and from Back ſliding; and of doing all that which is neceſſary on his part, for their perſevering and keeping to the end. And as concerning thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſt's prayer for the perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all true believers; and tha he was not heard in all he prayed for; if they do not all perſevere, this hath been anſwered in the Diſputation; how that Chriſt did not pray for their perſeverance in any other ſenſe, but by their careful and diligent uſe of the means God had vouchſafed them, they might be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34137:98"/>kept from falling; and in this ſenſe he was heard in all he prayed for, although with <hi>Judas,</hi> ſome True believers ſhould fall away; in this ſenſe he prayed that the World might believe, and that all believers might be in unity, and ſanctified, and kept in the World from evil, though we ſee few of the World do believe, or few believers live in that unity or are ſo ſanctified, as to be free from the evil of the World; therefore Chriſt's prayer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it ſelf, when he prays for believers ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>John</hi> 17 <hi>Sanctifie them THRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH THY TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH, thy word is Truth;</hi> So that one may run and read, that this prayer of Chriſt concerning the perſeverance of True believers was upon condition of their uſe of means, which was no more abſolute then his prayer, either for their ſanctity or unity; and neither the one or the other more then any, that God would ſo bleſs them in the uſe of ſuch means, that thereby they might attain thoſe bleſſed ends; all which implies, that it was poſſible for many things never to come to paſs, that Chriſt thus prayeth for; and yet he is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding heard alway, in all things.</p>
            <p>The laſt ground of this perſwaſion, that no True believer can ſiually fall away, is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the contrary doctrine of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of True beliezers falling, hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34137:99"/>conſequences attending it.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that it makes God changable, becauſe the Scripture faith, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I the Lord change not, therefore the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> Thence it is inferred, that if God hates thoſe whom he once loved, he is changable; to this I anſwer, that if God had promiſed to love men abſolutely, and without condition, then the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt be loved of God, though they were never ſo wicked, or elſe God muſt be ſubject to change.</p>
            <p>But this cannot be the ſenſe, becauſe, <hi>God hates all the workers of Iniquity;</hi> again, the Scripture tells us concerning <hi>Elia's</hi> Sons, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>I ſaid indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy Father ſhould walk before me for ever. But now ſaith she Lord, far be it from me; for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed of.</hi> The like we have in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8. <hi>At what time</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and a Kingdom, to plack up, &amp; to pull down, &amp; to deſtroy it; if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced it, turn from their evil, I will repent me of the evil that I thought to do unto them: And at what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, them will I repent of

            <p>The other abſurdity is, that the doctrine of the poſſibility of True believers, final a poſtacy, is deſtructive of all true Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, it were unreaſonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, to think that the ancient Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that differed in this point, had no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peace, and that ſuch holy men as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and multitudes more were deprived of Chriſtian peace, who have manifeſted ſo great confidence, and joy both in their lives and writings.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34137:100"/>ſhould uncomfortably vex themſelves with fears, leſt their Parents ſhould hate them, or disinherit them; yet, or that no Son can from hence take comfort in his Fathers Love, and there is no man of the greateſt holyneſs, is certain he ſhall not fall into ſome fowl ſin (this is acknowledged by all) he is not certain but he may be Drunk as <hi>Noah</hi> was, or inceſtious as <hi>Lot</hi> was, commit Adultery and Murder as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, deny Chriſt as <hi>Peter</hi> did; and if you were ſure you ſhould fall thus, would it not even break your hearts; but what muſt all Chriſtians live in doubts, and he uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable becauſe of this? you are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but you may for ſuch capital crimes, be hanged at a Gallows, and be made a publick example to the World.

            <p>This being on all hands allowed for the height of <hi>Antinomianiſm;</hi> let us now ſee, how men that would be thought otherwiſe, minded agree with it; To this purpoſe ſee Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Treatiſe of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Joſeph Caryl</hi>'s Commendatory Epiſtle to it, Printed 1671. pag 91. <hi>if a man know himſelf under the Covenant of Grace, then he doth not fear Damnation for his diſobedience,</hi> and pag. 94. <hi>A chriſtian doth not fear Livorce for his diſobedience; for if we look for curſing for our diſobedience, we are not under Chriſt, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34137:102"/>the Law; but he that is freed from the Covenant of Works, is freed from expecting Salvation, or fearing Damnation for what he doth,</hi> and p. 96, 97. <hi>Laſtly, the Soul doth not claim his right unto any conditional Promiſes, by his performing the Condition; Nor doth he deny himſelf the bleſſing that the Promiſe may reach forth to him, though he may be wanting in obedience to this or that Commandment.—This is the freedom of a chriſtian Soul, whereas another man, if he have kept the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and performed the Condition, he then looketh for acceptance with God, as if the Lord had made this promiſe, that he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find Mercy; this man confeſſeth his ſin unto God, and forſaketh it, and therefore he looks for mercy.</hi> BUT THIS IS NOT THE MANNER OF GODS PEOPLE.</p>
            <p>No marvail they cannot periſh if they have a way to ſalvation, without either confeſſing or forſaking ſin, but from ſuch people of God, whoſe manner is neither to confeſs nor forſake their ſins in order to ſalvation or find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, this ſhall be my Letany, <hi>Libera nos Domine.</hi>

            <p>I do not wonder that men have run into Ranteriſm, and all the abominations of the Gnoſticks of old, under the pretence of their being the darlings of God, and favourites of the Court of Heaven; having ſancied they have abſolue promiſes of Salvation; and therefore have no reaſon to queſtion their condition, or fear their Damnation, though their ſins be never ſo great.

            </p>
            <p>To this agrees the Learned Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> in his Sermon before the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> Feb. 28. 1647. <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the greatneſs of thy ſin, nor thy continuance in thy ſin, nor thy back-ſliding into ſin, that is the true cauſe of thy ſtaggering, but ſolely from thy unbelief.</hi> This agrees with Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> and Doctor <hi>Criſp; that if they be believers, and once ſet their footing upon Chriſt; they need not ſtagger for the greatneſs of their ſins, nor their continuance in them</hi>

            <p>To all this may be added ſome doctrins laid down in a Treatiſe of Juſtification, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> with Doctor <hi>Owen's</hi> Commendatory Epiſtle: ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>He lays down this doctrine, <hi>That in the new Covenant there is no condition required to intitle us to the bleſſings of it;</hi> and thence he draws this Corrollary, <hi>that Faith is not a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34137:104"/>condition of the new Covenant;</hi> he further ſaith, <hi>That the Elect</hi> Corinthians; <hi>that were</hi> Idolaters, Fornicators, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, and Extortioners, <hi>had no more right to Salvation after their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, then they had before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it ſeems they had, a right to Heaven, if they had died in this condition, and never believed; for Faith (he ſays) is no condition of the Covenant, that is the doctrin, and that men in the height of their impieties, and exceſs of wickedneſs have (if Elected) as much right to Heaven then, as when converted, that is the application; ſo that if they can ſet foot upon Chriſt by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they may be ſaved though they dye unbelievers; for Faith, he ſaith is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it.</p>
            <p>Somewhat to this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Edward Bagſhaw</hi> dogmatizeth in his book Intituled, <hi>The Doctrine of free Grace in pardoning Sin, without conditions,</hi> page 25. he explains himſelf, what he means by free Grace; <hi>By free here I do not mean free, as excluding Chriſt, but as excluding our ſelves, or any thing we can do, as a cauſe procuring, or as</hi> a condition qualifying us <hi>for the receiving of it.</hi>

            <pb n="198" facs="tcp:34137:105"/>
            <p>Lord! Whether will theſe opinions lead us? or rather, whether will they not lead us? ſometimes they tell us if we are believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we need not queſtion our condition though our ſins are never ſo great. Now we are told, that if we are Elected, we are well enough; for Faith is no condition of the covenant of Grace; and that we are no nearer Salvation after we believe, then we were before: for that is the ſenſe (for ſaith he) <q>The Elect <hi>Corinthians</hi> had no more right to Heaven after their believing, then they had while they were unbelievers, Whoremongers, and Adulterers.</q> Thus they make even our Faith of none effect; upon which words, the learned and ſober Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſaith, <q>he never read the like in any writings of God or man (page 193.) What! that ſome men (ſaith Mr <hi>Woodbridge</hi>) that live in Adulteries, Idolatries, Blaſphemies, Murders and all manner of ungodlyneſs; yet have as much right to Heaven, as the moſt Faithful, Humble, Mortified, Chriſtian, or Apoſtle, the height of whoſe bleſſedneſs it is, that they have RIGHT to enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14.

            <p>But if this bleſſedneſs may be had in the <q>ſervice of Sin and Sathan (ſaith he) and in the fulfilling the luſt of the Fleſh, and of the Mind, and in the unfruitful works of Darkneſs; let us eat and drink for to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow ſhall be as to day, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but he further adds this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> none have right to Heaven; but under the notion of a reward; but wicked and ungodly men that live in contempt of God and all good; have no right to Heaven; under the notion of reward; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they have no right at all.</q> Thus far Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> late Miniſter of <hi>Newbury</hi> enters his proteſt againſt Mr. <hi>Eyers.</hi>

            <p>May not any man (if this doctrine be true) take the ſame liberty to commit any the moſt enormious crimes, and bring this in barr, to divert divine vengeance, when he ſhall be impleaded for it, and ſay, true Lord, I was guilty of horrid Crimes, and added Drunkenneſs to Thirſt; but I was pardoned of all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come; and therefore it is not juſt thou ſhouldeſt judge me for them.</p>
